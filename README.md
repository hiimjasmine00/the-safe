# The Safe
A collection of daily and weekly levels for the game "Geometry Dash" by RobTop Games.

# My Process
- First I ran a script to download all the safe levels from the Geometry Dash servers.
- Then, I ran a script to extract the levels from a spreadsheet and convert them to a JSON format.
- Finally, I ran a script to extract the dates and daily/weekly IDs from the levels and merge them with the level data.
- I then manually tweaked the data to remove any errors or duplicates.

# Usage
You can use the data in this repository to create your own Geometry Dash daily/weekly level list or to analyze the data in any way you like.
